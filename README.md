# ESP32_blAudio_lite
Hello Simos. I chose this path because I did not know how to contact you. "https://forum.esk8.news/t/general-diy-audio-project-thread/14032/10" I could not reach the DSP project made with STA309A in the project mentioned in this link. If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could share the project on github. Sorry for causing you inconvenience. Thanks.
